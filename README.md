# Little-Lemon-dinner-menu
My training projects



Little Lemon is a charming neighborhood bistro that serves simple food and classic cocktails in a lively but casual environment. The restaurant features a locally-sourced menu with daily specials.

Little Lemon has chosen to digitize its menu, which makes it relatively easy for customers to browse menu items at night. Also, the customers can perform search queries with filter and sort options to find the items they are interested in faster.

Task:

1) Create a grid layout to display mock data of food, drink and dessert menu items.
2) Embed a right navigation button to open a "menu item options" settings page with filtering and sorting options (filter and sort functionalities are not required, but is a worthwhile challenge).
3) Provide additional information on selected menu items when users interact with the menu.
